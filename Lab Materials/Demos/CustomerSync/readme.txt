This project outlines the process to execute the application against a server. For Windows, you can use IIS Express with the correct settings
The ServerSync API folder contains an example that simulates a server that stores requests from Mobile applications and handles synchronisation of data

In order to run it, you should run it on IIS or on IIS Express as long as you have appropriate firewall ports open. You may need to confgigure your
application once it has been completed to point to the new IP address/port using IIS Express. 

The network connection should be able to be connected to the system.
